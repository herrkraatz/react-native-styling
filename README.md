# React Native Styling

This tutorial shall mostly take away the fear of styling a React Native App. React Native will translate your 
JavaScript camelCase style properties into platform specific styles (iOS and Android).

Thoughts:

- You will mostly use Flexbox (`flex`) to do the layout
- To do platform specific Styling, use `Platform` Component
- To do Responsive Styling, use `Dimensions` Component
- Also think of using/buying an Out-of-the-Box Template like React Native Sketch Elements: https://react-native.shop/elements

*Notes:*

- This is NOT an in-depth tutorial, just an overview.
- We do NOT talk about Global Styling (with Custom Components), Animations, and Image Handling.
- BUT it should give a good overview of the main topics of React Native Styling :-)

## <a id="chapter1"></a>1. Getting Started

*Notes:*

- No Mac needed.

### My Setup

This tutorial was created using

- Mac OS X version High Sierra, 10.13.4 (`sw_vers`) 
- Node.js version v9.11.1 (`node -v`)
  
### Node.js installed ?

If you haven't Node.js installed on your machine, please install current (latest), OR LTS version of Node.js ([By download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [By package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)).

*Note: LTS version is more stable and must be sufficient for this tutorial.*

This will install Node.js (JavaScript engine) on your machine, and allows JavaScript code to execute not only in your browser.
Node.js also ships with npm package manager we will need below.


## <a id="chapter2"></a>2. Let's dive into Styling Patterns

## <a id="chapter2a"></a>i. Which components can be styled?

You can only add styles to these 4 components (or components that are composed from these 4 components):

- Image
- ScrollView
- Text
- View

Example styling:

1. First create a styles object

    ```
    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
        container: {
            flex: 1,
            backgroundColor: "blue"
        }
    });
    ```

2. Then attach it to style property on component:

    ```
    <View style={styles.container}>
        {props.children}
    </View>
    ```

## <a id="chapter2b"></a>ii. StyleSheet.create() vs. {}

We quickly compare this ...

```
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: "white"
    }
});
```

... against using a "normal" JavaScript object:

```
const styles = {
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: "white"
    }
};
```
 
Use StyleSheet.create() whenever possible because it

- validates the styles
- sends the styles to native code more efficiently


## <a id="chapter2c"></a>iii. Layout with Flexbox `flex`

The three basic properties of Flexbox are:

```
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center"
    }
});
```

This will give the container a maximum possible size on the screen and centers its elements vertically and horizontally.

More detailed:

- `flex: 1`: Take ALL available space or more precisely: `flex: 1` is component's priority to get a piece of the available space 
on the screen. E.g. if you have 2 sibling containers with `flex: 1`, both containers get 50% of the available space.

- `justifyContent: "center"`: `justifyContent` means, by default, vertical positioning, i.e. positioning in main direction, 
which is column by default: `flexDirection: "column"`, so from top to bottom = vertically. 
So `justifyContent: "center"` tells React Native to center the elements in the container vertically.

- `alignItems: "center"`: `alignItems` means, by default, horizontal positioning, i.e. positioning on cross-axis 
to main direction above (cross-axis means 90 degrees from the axis (main direction) of justifyContent above).
So `alignItems: "center"` tells React Native to center the elements in the container horizontally.

## <a id="chapter2d"></a>iv. Styling with Units & Relative Units

To give a component a specific size (e.g. width = 200px), do the following:

```
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center"
    },
    input: {
        width: 200
    }
});
```

Attach it easily:

```
<View style={styles.container}>
    <TextInput placeholder"Your Username" style={styles.input} />
</View>
```

To be more flexible if you want to re-use the component in other parts of the app, you might want to give it a Relative Unit (e.g. width = 75%):

```
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center"
    },
    input: {
        width: "75%"
    }
});
```


## <a id="chapter2e"></a>v. Platform specific Styling with `Platform` Component

The easiest:

```
if (Platform.OS === "android") {

    // do styling for Android

}
```

And:

```
if (Platform.OS === "ios") {

    // do styling for iOS

}
```

## <a id="chapter2f"></a>vi. Responsive Styling with `Dimensions` Component

In order to, say, change a responsive container's Flexbox's main direction 
from vertical `flexDirection:: "column"` to horizontal `flexDirection:: "row"` 
when user rotates his/her device from portrait to landscape:

```
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    responsiveContainer: {
        flex: 1,
        flexDirection: Dimensions.get("window").height > 500 ? "column" : "row"
    },
    input: {
        width: "75%"
    }
});
```


## <a id="chapter2g"></a>vii. Dynamic Styling with `Dimensions` Component's Event Listener `change`

The key is to use `Dimensions.addEventListener("change", dims => {})` function to listen to dimension changes (rotation of the device).

It is placed inside the constructor of the component. When the rotation event occurs, the `this.setState()` is called 
causing a re-rendering of the component with the adjusted style properties for the current device's orientation:


```
class OurResponsiveComponent extends Component {
  state = {
    respStyles: {
      pwContainerDirection: "column",
      pwContainerJustifyContent: "flex-start",
      pwWrapperWidth: "100%"
    }
  };

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    Dimensions.addEventListener("change", dims => {
      this.setState({
        respStyles: {
          pwContainerDirection:
            Dimensions.get("window").height > 500 ? "column" : "row",
          pwContainerJustifyContent:
            Dimensions.get("window").height > 500
              ? "flex-start"
              : "space-between",
          pwWrapperWidth: Dimensions.get("window").height > 500 ? "100%" : "45%"
        }
      });
    });
  }
  
  render() {
      return (
      ...
```
